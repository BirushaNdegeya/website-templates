## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The most important things I learned were how to use SCSS variables across SCSS files and how to create multiple files instead of using one long CSS file.

```css
.wrapper {
  width: 90%;
  margin: 3rem auto;
  border-radius: 8px;
  overflow: hidden;
  max-width: 375px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

### Continued development

In this column-preview-component challenge, I learned how to use SCSS and integrate it into my project. For future projects, I would like to start using Sass, which is an excellent CSS compiler, and begin creating my own CSS library.
